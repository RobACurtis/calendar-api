# church-calendar-api vs. calendarium-romanum

If you want to improve the Church Calendar API website
or extend the API itself, this is the right place to do it.

If you want to contribute

* a calendar data file
* additional localization
* fix or report a calendar computing error

please, head over to the [calendarium-romanum][caro] repository
and open a pull-request or an issue there.
Church Calendar API itself is only a thin presentation layer
around the `calendarium-romanum` gem.
